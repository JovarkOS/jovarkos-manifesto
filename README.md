# jovarkos-manifesto

Jovarkos is a distribution with our primary focuses on ease of use, speed, stability, and most of all, usefullness.
Here are our main points:
* We hold that a distro need not be hard to use for a beginner to be suitable for an expert.
* We hold to a philosophy generally of utility over shipping only free software, however, free software is generally preferred if the user experience is not degraded.
* We hold that a great part of utility is often aesthetics, which means that all software we ship must not only perform well, and be useful, but look good.
* We hold that workflow must be uniform, and not hacky, at least on the user side of things.
* We will ship one simple application to do one simple job. Leaving the user to decide to install more complex user specific software for their own needs.
* We believe that the graphical and command line side of linux can coexist, and server different purposes, therefore we will attempt to ship graphical software where it is more practical, but also useful command line tools, with some minimal overlap between them where the needs of both new and expert users must be met.
